git commit -m "Fix: Frontend API connection and CORS issues

FIXES:
- Correct API endpoint URLs: /api/v1/products â†’ /api/v1/products/ (trailing slash)
- Add production CORS origins: www.ursaviour.com, ursaviour.com
- Support both HTTP and HTTPS for domain transition
- Fix Mixed Content warnings for HTTPS sites

Changes:
- frontend/src/js/product_page.js: Fix API endpoint URLs
- backend/app/main.py: Add production domains to CORS

This resolves the 'Backend service unavailable: Failed to fetch' error."
