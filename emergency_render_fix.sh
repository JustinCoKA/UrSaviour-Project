git commit -m "EMERGENCY FIX: Complete rendering failure debug

CRITICAL ISSUE: Products page shows no products at all
- Live debug works perfectly but products page completely broken
- Suspect: Dynamic script loading caused JavaScript execution failure

FIXES:
1. Revert to static script loading with new cache version
2. Add emergency debug logging to render() function  
3. Add fallback error display if no products render
4. Add 3-second delayed check for empty products

This will show exactly where rendering fails."
