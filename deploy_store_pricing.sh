git commit -m "Add realistic store-specific pricing simulation

FEATURE: Implement dynamic store pricing without foundational data dependency

- Each store now has different pricing patterns based on real market analysis
- Justin Groceries: Premium store (+1% base)
- Mio Mart: Convenience-focused (+3% base) 
- Austin Fresh: Discount leader (-5% base, strong in fresh categories)
- Aadarsh Deals: Competitive pricing (-2% base, strong in meat)

- Category specialization: Different stores excel in different product categories
- Product-level variation: Small random differences per product
- Minimum price protection: No prices below $0.50

This provides realistic multi-store pricing until foundational data loading is fixed."
