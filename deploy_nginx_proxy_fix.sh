git commit -m "Fix: Use nginx proxy for production API calls

CRITICAL FIX: Production API connectivity
- Use relative paths in production (empty API_BASE)
- Nginx proxy handles /api/ routes to backend
- Added API debug page for testing connectivity
- Resolves Mixed Content and CORS issues

Changes:
- frontend/src/js/product_page.js: Use nginx proxy in production
- frontend/src/api-debug.html: Debug page for API testing

This should resolve the 'Failed to fetch' error by using proper nginx routing."
